I'd like to keep this project to myself, so I don't want others to change this project (nobody will probably be interested in doing that anyways). If you for some reason really want to change something about this repository, please copy its contents to a new repository instead. If you do that, I'd be happy if you mentioned me in it, but there really isn't anything I can do if you don't.
